## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Please email hanhannah839@gmail.com for any questions or concerns.
Create GitHub Issues for bug reports and feature requests.

Future roadmap may include:
Would like to add a star rating to the movie
